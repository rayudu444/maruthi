        <p>At Maruthicabs, we aim to provide a fair deal for both passengers and drivers. For the service to work well for everyone, we rely on people keeping their promises.
<br /><br />
When a driver accepts a job using Maruthicabs, the passenger has a right to expect that driver to turn up, and when a passenger hails a taxi using Maruthicabs, the driver should expect that passenger to be at the pickup address.
<br /><br />
Sometimes there are legitimate reasons for a cancellation, but if either party cancels without a fair reason, it is frustrating for the other person and we think it is reasonable for that behavior to be discouraged.
<br /><br />
If any of our drivers continually cancel jobs without good reason, we have a compliance procedure in place that could ultimately see them removed from the Maruthicabs network. Conversely, when a passenger cancels without good reason the driver should expect some small compensation to cover his or her time. For this reason we are introducing the Maruthicabs Cancellation Policy.
<br /><br />
<span class="bold-text">1.</span>	If a driver has not been confirmed, and you cancel, you will not be charged the cancellation fee.
<br /><br />
<span class="bold-text">2.</span>	If you cancel within 30 minutes of your taxi being confirmed you will not be charged the cancellation fee.
<br /><br />
<span class="bold-text">3.</span>	If after 30 minutes before 10 minutes of your taxi being confirmed you decide to cancel, we will let you know that you will be charged a cancellation fee of Rs.150 should you choose to confirm your cancellation.
<br /><br />
<span class="bold-text">4.</span>	If you do not board the taxi at the pickup location within 15 minutes of the taxi arriving or you and the driver have made contact, the Rs.250 cancellation fee will apply.
<br /><br />
Where possible, we encourage our passengers to contact their driver directly prior to cancelling as this tends to resolve many misunderstandings.
