       <br />
	• However, in case you have booked a Maruthicabs & the cab is crossing the toll post while coming to pick you up, then you need not pay the toll charges.

          <p><b>Q .</b> Can I use the cab without flagging down the meter?</p>
       <p><b>A .</b>We track every fare that the Maruthicabs is taking at our Technology Center and actively dissuade our chauffeurs from taking an un-metered fare. An un-metered fare is in violation of the Department of Transport rules and exposes the chauffeur to penal action. 
Moreover, if you have a complaint against the chauffeur, you would not have a valid e-receipt at the end of your journey to make a valid complaint.
